				Classification of endometrial cancer cells using CNN
Abstract :

Cancer detection is one of the important but tedious tasks for the pathologists. Given this context,
computer-aided mechanisms emerge as the most prominent and beneficial assistance to the detectors. 
Hence, it is certain that CAD will become handy for the application of cancer detection.
Computer Aided Detection (CADe) / Computer Aided Diagnosis (CADx) is approached to detect 
endometrial cancer, a specific type of cancer that arises in women, as it has been used in the 
detection of a variety of cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung lesions.  
Convolutional Neural Networks, a deep learning algorithm, is integrated in CADe for effective endometrial 
cancer detection.

Introduction :

To develop a method that assists the pathology department in the early and accurate evaluation of 
histopathological images, thereby:
•	Detecting cancerous patients and caution them for treatment.
•	Avoiding unnecessary radiotherapies to non-cancerous women. 
Identifying the problem type: Binary and multi-class classification problem 
Binary classification: benign or malignant
Multi-class classification: NE / EP / EH / EA
